\hspace{-6.53mm}  First and foremost, all praise be to God, the most Gracious, the most Merciful. Secondly, I would like to sincerely thank my father, whose support made my education possible. His contribution was invaluable, and although he is no longer with us, his impact and guidance continue to inspire me. My thoughts and prayers are with all my other family members who have been victims of the ongoing genocide in Gaza, Palestine. The loss of these loved ones will never be forgotten, and they remain a constant source of motivation in my efforts. Thirdly, I am greatly thankful to my supervisor, Hector Mendez Benito, for his unwavering support and understanding throughout this challenging academic year. His guidance was important in navigating the complexities of my research and personal hardships. Additional thanks go to John McNamara, who facilitated our collaboration with IBM stakeholders. Last but not least, I am grateful to Andry Bohutsky, a knowledgeable cryptocurrency investor and start-upper, who provided timely advice and expert guidance on smart contracts. This thesis would not have been possible without the contributions and support of each of these individuals.
