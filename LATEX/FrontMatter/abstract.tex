This thesis explores how smart contracts might optimise employment processes by reducing administrative tasks and increasing security for both employers and employees. The proposed solution applies a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 Turbo model to translate traditional legal employment contracts into smart ones. The software developed includes a backend system and a frontend mobile application as means to interact with the platform. The primary objective of this software is to enable user-employers and user-employees to manage their interactions efficiently through the system, which autonomously verifies that parties adhere to their contractual obligations. Additionally, by examining the strength and limitations of the technology, this research investigates the potential of smart contracts in improving other practices on the web where the problem of mutual trust exists. The findings propose directions for future research to tackle existing issues.
